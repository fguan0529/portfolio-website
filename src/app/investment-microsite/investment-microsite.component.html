        <h4 class="section-header">Goal</h4>
        <p>We designed a concept microsite for [ <i>company name omitted</i> ]
          to engage new potential investors and educate them on the companyâ€™s
          investing process.</p>
        <h4 class="section-header">Notes</h4>
        <p>
          This project was a sponsored collaboration between UCI's Senior Design Project course and
          a company who chooses to be unnamed. Though the company name is still included in our source
          code, they would like to remain unassociated. The company is an investment management
          company that manages mutual funds and other financial services.

    <p>
      After the initial elicitation sessions with the sponsor, it was decided they wanted a product
      that communicated with a new target audience of potential new investors.
