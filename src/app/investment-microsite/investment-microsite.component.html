        <h4 class="section-header">Goal</h4>
        <p>We designed a concept microsite for [ <i>company name omitted</i> ]
          to engage new potential investors and educate them on the companyâ€™s
          investing process.</p>

        <p>
          This project was a sponsored collaboration between UCI's Senior Design Project course and
          a company who chooses to be unnamed. Though the company name is still included in our source
          code, they would like to remain unassociated. The company is an investment management
          company that manages mutual funds and other financial services.

    <h3 class="section-header">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Initially, the sponsor did not know the exact product they wanted. They did know that they
      wanted to connect with new target audience that the company did not reach due to
      their communication style of their existing website and material and lack of marketing. In the
      initial stages of the project, we had a little miscommunication with the sponsor in terms of
      expectations of the project. The sponsor initially expected more marketing content out of us
      while we, the team, were expecting to deliver a more technical approach that our skillsets
      would provide. We were able to overcome this and communicate more concisely with our sponsor
      moving forward.
    </p>

      <h5 class="font-weight-bold lavender-text">Mission Statement</h5>
      <h4>
        The microsite should fulfill our three main goals: to <b class="bigger-text">clearly explain</b>
        the company's core values and investing style to a <b class="bigger-text">new audience</b>,
        to express the <b class="bigger-text">unique advantages</b> of company's investing style, and
        to deliver the key points of information in an <b class="bigger-text">easy</b> and
        <b class="bigger-text">digestible</b> manner.
      </h4>
    </div>

    <h3 class="section-header">Design Process</h3>
    <p>
      Even though we worked in Agile, the sponsor wanted separate design and implementation phases to
      first deliver design deliverables before starting implementation. So for the first few sprints, we
      delivered research, sketches, mockups and, finally, a prototype to work off of. Much of the planning
      revolved around the marketing aspect as well, figuring out how to thoroughly inform as well as
      engage the user with the company's investing services as they interact with the microsite.

    <h3 class="section-header mt-3">Personas</h3>
    <p>
      The sponsor explained to us that the audience they wanted the product to connect to were young
      professionals as well as older women nearing retirement. They felt they currently lack any
      connection to these target groups. Initial plans also considered the three groups of user types
      that the company works with: investor, advisor and institution. These user types were taken into
      consideration in our personas. The project itself ended up only focusing on investors in later
      iterations.

      <h5 class="font-weight-bold lavender-text">The Problem</h5>
      <h4>
        The company's current website information is <b class="bigger-text">hard to understand</b>
        for non-industry individuals and those new to the investing. The
        <b class="bigger-text">lack of marketing</b> also contributes to the
        resulting gap in their client demographic, leaving an <b class="bigger-text">untapped
        source</b> of potential new investors.
      </h4>
    </div>

    <h3 class="section-header">Website Flow Plan</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of overwhelming a user with too much information and background when they arrive
      on the website, we wanted to provide interactive features that allow them to familiarize
      themselves with the company and provide them resources.
