        <p>
          The Portfolio Website is my personal website I created to display my resume
          and projects. The website is implemented with Angular 7 and Bootstrap 4.

        <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-center">Content Plan</h4>
        <p>
          I started the project by laying out the content I needed the website to display. The most
          important contents I wanted the website to display were my <b>educational background</b> and
          <b>skillset</b> as well as direct access to my <b>paper resume</b>. Next, my <b>projects</b>
          are to take focus.

        <p>
          Having previously done a resume website before, I kept the old design in mind as reference to
          use features I liked and for areas of improvement. Keeping the introduction and skills areas
          clean and straightforward is a quality adopted from my previous resume website. For ideas on
          highlighting my projects, I took a look at a number of other portfolio websites in the
          industry. I came upon <a href="https://jihoonsuh.com/" target="_blank">Jihoon Suh's website</a>
          and took inspiration from the large thumbnails for his projects as well as how the project
          details are organized in their respective pages.

        My Portfolio Website should communicate my <b class="bigger-text">personality</b> to the
        visitor as well as readily provide access to my <b class="bigger-text">resume</b> and
        <b class="bigger-text">portfolio</b> of projects.

    <h3 class="section-header py-3">Webflow Prototype</h3>
    <p>
      Using Webflow, I was able to prototype the website before diving in to code it. Using Webflow's
      interface, I roughly organized my content and planned the aesthetic of the website.

      <h5 class="font-weight-bold lavender-text">The Problem</h5>
      <h4 class="text-focus-statement">
        Due to my lack of <b class="bigger-text">work experience</b>, my resume mainly consists of
        projects. My paper resume is not the best medium for displaying my skills applied through my
        <b class="bigger-text">projects</b>.
      </h4>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h3 class="section-header py-3">Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      I chose to use <b>Angular</b> as an opportunity to learn something new while working on this project. I
      was already familiar with <b>Bootstrap</b> so I utilized it as well along with <b>Sass</b>. After a few Angular tutorials, I
      began implementation of the website. Following my Webflow prototype, I laid the homepage out
      section by section. I also made sure all content was <b>mobile-friendly</b> every step of the way.

      <h4 class="text-focus-statement">
        A portfolio website gives me the <b class="bigger-text">platform</b> to display my work and
        simultaneously allows me to <b class="bigger-text">apply my skills</b> in implementing the website.

    <h3 class="section-header py-3">Finishing Touches</h3>
    <p>
      As the website was being filled with my content, I also slowly began to optimize the images a bit more by
      using SVGs for the icons and using transparent background images for the project thumbnails.
